\section{About Me}
\cvitem{}{
I recently completed a Bachelor of Engineering (BE) degree, majoring in Software Engineering with First Class Honours. I am a passionate engineer looking to make a positive impact on the world and improve the quality of people’s lives. I recently co-founded a company that provides a solution for the physically restricted and the elderly.} 

\cvitem{}{I enjoy working on both front-end and back-end applications with a strong emphasis on best practices, Object-oriented (OO) design principles, design patterns, user experience, and reusability. Specifically, I want a job focused in mobile development as it is a tool for bringing my ideas into reality. I am dynamic and have an attention to detail which allows me to understand fundamental concepts and learn new skills rapidly.}

\section{Projects}
\cventry{2016 (Present)}{Slick (Switch With A Click)}{}{}{}{
Website: \url{www.goslick.co.nz/}\newline{} 
Slick provides a solution to the elderly and the physically restricted allowing them to have more control of their home devices, increasing their independence. Slick flicks a switch on or off through a remote button or mobile application. I have worked on everything software related in this project, including the front-end and back-end of the website. I created the front-end in AngularJS and created a REST-API for the back-end in Ruby on Rails (RoR) which communicates with a PostgreSQL database. I am currently working on a web-based mobile application and will further expand to provide native solutions in iOs and Android. Keep updated by checking out our Facebook page at \url{www.facebook.com/solaceSlick}.
}
\cventry{2015}{Food Recommender System (Honours Project)}{}{}{}{
I worked on a hybrid recommendation algorithm that uses content-based filtering and collaborative filtering to provide personalised food dish recommendations to 91 users based on personal food preferences and previous rating patterns. I compared the effectiveness of the hybrid approach with a number of various collaborative filtering techniques and non-personalised recommendation techniques. Overall, the hybrid algorithm was able to provide personalised food dish recommendations at an accuracy of 87.06\%, outperforming the other algorithms and non-personalised recommendation methods used in the project.}
\cventry{Present}{More Projects}{}{}{}{I am actively learning new skills and working on different projects. To see more projects, please visit my GitHub at \url{www.github.com/haiquangtran.}}

% \cventry{2016 (Present)}{Personal Website}{}{}{}{
% Website: \url{www.Hai.World} \newline{}
% In my spare time I enjoy reading books. I am currently reading the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey and also learning more about design patterns by reading Head First Design Patterns by Eric Freeman et al. In order to internalize the lessons from these books, I am creating a personal website blog that allows me to summarize these books. The website is done in Jekyll which is a static blog generator in RoR using HTML, CSS, Sass and other front-end tools. The website is still in development.

% \section{Key skills}
% \cvitem{\textbf{Learning}}{I have a passion for learning. I am constantly having to learn new content at University, whether it be new process models, frameworks, algorithms or languages. I am currently learning HTML5/CSS to produce a website for my web design course. I am also learning the .NET framework to produce a Windows Phone 8 application for a real client. On top of that, I am learning SQL and databases}
% \cvitem{\textbf{Programming}}{I am passionate about programming as it allows me to bring ideas into reality. In my spare time, I am currently working on a Sticky Notes application in Android, looking to incorporate chat head functionality. I also incorporate my design skills when I program, producing programs that have high cohesion and low coupling which allows for easy implementation and extensibility. I have created programs such as a Tower Defense game, a Maze Solver, a Flappy Birds clone game, a 3D Renderer pipeline and many other programs.}
% \cvitem{\textbf{Design}}{I am experienced in making 2d graphics such as sprites or images in Adobe Illustrator or Adobe Photoshop. I have previously created an interactive data visualization application that allows users to identify trends and filter out netball information easily. This was made using the library d3. In the past I have created images and animations using Processing. I have also created 2d graphics for a series of games that I have created, the most recent being a clone of flappy bird, and a game called YOLO for the event “Pixel Jam”. }
% \cvitem{\textbf{Driven \& ambitious}}{I am a very ambitious and driven person. I am always setting new goals for myself and striving to achieve them. For example, one of my goals for this year was to learn to play the piano/keyboard. During this year I borrowed a keyboard from my friend and learnt how to play a few songs. I also go to the gym on a daily basis in order to relieve stress. I also read daily for at least half an hour to further gain knowledge and learn. }
% \cvitem{\textbf{Perfectionist}}{I always to try my best. I don’t feel comfortable if I do not try my best at everything I do. For example, I don’t feel comfortable submitting an incomplete assignment. I feel that if I let it happen that I will become complacent and that is not what I want for myself.}
